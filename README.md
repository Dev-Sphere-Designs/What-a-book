## Purpose
### What-a-book is a project designed to illustrate our teams ability to: 
* Draft a Technical Design Document based on user requirements
* Create working prototypes 
* Database modeling using ORDâ€™s and noSQL data structures
* Perform pymongo queries on MongoDB data
* Create a working Python console application 

## How to use What-a-book console application
### Application prerequisites:
* Installation of Python (Guide here: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
* Installation of pymongo Python package (Guide here: https://pypi.org/project/pymongo/)
* Installation of certifi Python package (Guide here: https://pypi.org/project/certifi/)

After installing Python and these packages, you should be able to run the application within a Command Line Interface (or using the run function within VSCode's tools).

If you wish to select other options within the interface, you will need to restart the application. 

Thank you for using What-A-Book!
